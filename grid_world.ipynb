The agent can move vertically or horizontally between grid cells in each timestep. The goal of the agent is to navigate to a target on the grid that has been placed randomly at the beginning of the episode.\n",

    "# Declaration and Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Our custom environment will inherit from the abstract class `gymnasium.Env`. You shouldn’t forget to add the metadata attribute to your class. There, you should specify the render-modes that are supported by your environment (e.g. `\"human\"`, `\"rgb_array\"`, `\"ansi\"`) and the framerate at which your environment should be rendered. Every environment should support `None` as render-mode; you don’t need to add it in the metadata. In `GridWorldEnv`, we will support the modes “rgb_array” and “human” and render at 4 FPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method of our environment will accept the integer `size`, that determines the size of the square grid. We will set up some variables for rendering and define `self.observation_space` and `self.action_space`. In our case, observations should provide information about the location of the agent and target on the 2-dimensional grid. We will choose to represent observations in the form of dictionaries with keys `\"agent\"` and `\"target\"`. An observation may look like `{\"agent\": array([1, 0]), \"target\": array([0, 3])}`. Since we have 4 actions in our environment (“right”, “up”, “left”, “down”), we will use `Discrete(4)` as an action space. "
